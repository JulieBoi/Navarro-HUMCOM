                 <text id="DescOne">A Day to Remember (often abbreviated ADTR) is an American rock band from Ocala, Florida, founded in the spring of 2003 by guitarist Tom Denney and drummer Bobby Scruggs. They are known for their amalgamation of metalcore and pop punk. The band currently consists of vocalist Jeremy McKinnon, rhythm guitarist Neil Westfall, bassist Joshua Woodard, percussionist/drummer Alex Shelnutt and lead guitarist Kevin Skaff.  
                     
                <p>Signing with<a href="http://www.indianolarecords.com/" target="_blank" title=""> Indianola Records</a>
                for their first album, And Their Name Was Treason (2005), Scruggs was
                replaced by Shelnutt in 2006. Later that year the band recorded For Those Who Have Heart (2007) for
                <a href="https://victoryrecords.com/" target="_blank" title=""> Victory Records.</a>
                They embarked on several tours of the UK and U.S. and played at several festivals
                before recording and releasing Homesick (2009). While promoting Homesick on tour, Denney was replaced by
                Skaff. Soon after releasing their next album, What Separates Me from You (2010), the band wenton a
                worldwide tour to promote it. Since 2011, the band has been involved in a lawsuit with Victory Records
                over their recording contract. In October 2013 the band was given the right to self-release new albums
                until a final verdict is reached. They released their fifth album, Common Courtesy, that month. In 2016,
                the band released their sixth album, Bad Vibrations.They're set to release their seventh album You're
                Welcome on March 5, 2021 and will be their first release under

                <text id="question"><p>Why "A Day To Remember"?</p></text>

                <text id="DescTwo">“It came from the old drummer, Bobby,”  explains guitarist Kevin Skaff. “This was a long-ass time ago back in
                Ocala, Florida – probably 2003. Bobby had this girlfriend and she just randomly blurted the name out during
                a practice of something. I remember everybody being like, ‘It sounds pretty cool, maybe we should use that.’
                The funny part is that we ended up kicking Bobby out like two shows later and keeping the name. Maybe that’s
                not so funny, but he was a pretty bad drummer.”</text>
