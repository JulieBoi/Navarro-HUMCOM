        <ul>
            <li> Set in a small town during the 1950s, 
                A Walk to Remember is the story of an only son of a 
                <font color = 'red'><b><i>wealthy</i></b></font> family that finds 
                true love with the most unexpected person. 
                The <font color = 'red'><b><i></i>daughter</i></b></font> 
                of a minister <u>(Mandy Moore)</u> meets the only son 
                <u>(Shane West)</u> and the story takes us through hard times, 
                love and bitter sweet passion. This great love story shows us that 
                it all comes down to who is by your side and who is willing to 
                stand up for love even when it seems impossible.</li>
